# Task List Maintenance

// Description: Ensures all new ideas, tasks, and bug fixes are added to the task list
// Recommended Globs: **/tasks/**/*.md, **/tasks-*.md, **/tasks_*.md

## Rule Description

**MANDATORY**: Any idea, task, bug fix, or feature that is not already documented in the task list (`tasks_MVP.md`) MUST be added to the task list immediately, before implementation begins.

## When to Add to Task List

### Must Add:
- ✅ New features or functionality discussed
- ✅ Bug fixes discovered or reported
- ✅ Technical improvements or optimizations
- ✅ Refactoring tasks
- ✅ Documentation updates
- ✅ Testing requirements
- ✅ Deployment tasks
- ✅ Any work item that requires implementation

### Examples:
- "We should add error handling for X" → Add as sub-task
- "This bug needs fixing" → Add as bug fix task
- "Let's optimize the image generation" → Add as optimization task
- "We need to add logging here" → Add as observability task

## How to Add

1. **Identify the appropriate PR/Phase** in `tasks_MVP.md`
2. **Add as a sub-task** under the relevant PR
3. **Use checkbox format**: `- [ ] Description of task`
4. **Include context** if needed (why it's needed, what it should do)
5. **Update "Relevant Files"** section when the task is completed

## Format

```markdown
- [ ] **Task name**
  * Description of what needs to be done
  * Any additional context or requirements
```

## Enforcement

- **Before starting work**: Check if the task exists in the task list
- **If not found**: Add it first, then proceed
- **During implementation**: If new subtasks emerge, add them immediately
- **After completion**: Mark as `[x]` and update "Relevant Files"

## AI Instructions

When the AI or user suggests:
1. A new feature
2. A bug fix
3. An improvement
4. Any work item

The AI MUST:
1. First check if it exists in `tasks_MVP.md`
2. If not found, add it to the appropriate section
3. Then proceed with implementation (if approved)
4. Mark as complete when done

## Exception

Only skip adding to task list if:
- The item is already explicitly documented in the task list
- It's a trivial typo fix or formatting change that takes < 1 minute

## Purpose

- Maintain comprehensive project documentation
- Track all work items in one place
- Ensure nothing falls through the cracks
- Provide clear project roadmap
- Enable better planning and estimation
