# Project Brief

## Project Name
Video Stitching App - MVP

## Core Mission
Enable users to generate a short, cohesive, stylized advertisement-style video within 10–15 minutes, from landing on the website to receiving a downloadable final video.

## Primary Goals (MVP)

1. **Enable rapid video creation**: Users can create a stylized multi-clip video (15–30 seconds) in under 15 minutes
2. **Intuitive UX**: Support both users who know their vision and users discovering it
3. **Cost optimization**: Minimize unnecessary generation costs by:
   - Generating images only in early phases
   - Generating videos only once, after storyboard confirmation
4. **Quality output**: Produce final videos meeting:
   - 1080p resolution
   - 30+ FPS
   - 3–5 scenes
   - Audio included
5. **AI-friendly architecture**: System designed so an AI agent can generate or modify code safely

## Non-Goals (MVP)

- User accounts, authentication, or history saving
- Full editing of scenes
- Regenerating individual scenes
- Multi-aspect-ratio outputs
- Full-featured music generation or selection
- Lip-sync, actor tracking, or long-form storylines

## Success Criteria

- A user with no technical skill can produce a 15–30 second ad video
- Final video meets quality specs (1080p, 30+ FPS, 3–5 scenes, audio)
- Entire flow completes in < 15 minutes
- Costs are logged and tracked
- Pipeline is stable and observable

## Project Scope
MVP focused on three-stage workflow: **Inspire Me → Crafting the Story → Generate the Video**
